Sarvam Exports - A B2B Digital Showroom

I built this project to create a modern, elegant, and highly interactive web presence for a home textile export company. The goal wasn't just to build another e-commerce site, but a proper B2B digital showroom designed to impress international clients and generate business inquiries.

The entire experience is crafted to feel high-end and unique, from the "stitching machine" loading animation to the immersive, full-screen product carousel.
